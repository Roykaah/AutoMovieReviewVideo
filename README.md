# AutoMovieReviewVideo
 Automatically generates a video review with voice and images about the last movie you logged in Letterboxd.
 
 All the steps to make a video:
 1. Log a movie on Letterboxd (I already do that anyway)
 2. Record a audio talking about the movie and put it in "data/samples/inputs" as "aud.mp3"
 3. Run main.py
 
You may encounter some problems opening the "final video.mp4" file, but if you upload it to Youtube it will open normally. 

Maybe in future updates I'll restore the option of uploading automatically to Youtube.
